After the 10,000 probabilities are created, they should be analyzed to determine every occurance of TCap being greater than RS. This analysis constitutes 1 round. 100 rounds should be performed for each occurence (Count_of_TCap_Output>RSMax)/10,000, (Count_of_RS_Output<TCapMin)/10,000, (Count_of_TCap_Output>PMean for RS)/10,000, (Count_of_RS_Output<PMean for TCap)/10,000, (Count_of_TCap_Output>RSMin)/10,000, (Count_of_RS_Output<TCapMax)/10,000
