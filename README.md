A Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) .NET application in C# using R Studio tools to run Monte Carlo simulations

Code is still under development to intergrate the technical functions into a clean .NET application.

While in development, please review the supporting documents for technical aspects of the code needed to be developed, and for the UI workflow

Manifesto - 
Create an open source risk assement application using the FAIR Methodology and community input to allow for the most appropriate analysis of risk to company assests. Utilize application to allow technical SME's across disciplines to develop an accurate assessment of risks. Report these risk is simple terms to allow for C class level to understand underlying impacts in events per year and estimated losses. Stop analyzing risks in subjective terms at these higher levels as being High or Low with no objective definition to these terms or tie in to the organizational objective. Step 3, profit.
