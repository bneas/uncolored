A Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) .NET application in C# using R Studio tools to run Monte Carlo simulations

Code is still under development to intergrate the technical functions into a clean .NET application.

While in development, please review the supporting documents for technical aspects of the code needed to be developed, and for the UI workflow

Manifesto - Because we can

Create an open source risk assement application using the FAIR Methodology and community input to allow for the most appropriate analysis of risk to company assests. Utilize application to allow technical SME's across disciplines to develop an accurate assessment of risks.
