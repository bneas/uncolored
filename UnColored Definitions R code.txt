The following variables will be calculated based on the user input:
For the calculations, each section (i.e. Vulnerability (Vuln), Threat Event Frequency (TEF), etc.) will have a PERT Mean (PMean) established and a PERT Standard Deviation (PSD)

PERT Mean weighting will vary based on the confidence level. For Very High CL, the weighting will be (Min + (4*ML) + Max)/6. For each level down, the ML will be decreased by .5, and the Min and Max increased by .25 each. Very Low Rating would be calculated as ((2*Min) + (2*ML) + (2*Max))/6

PERT Standard Deviation will be calculated as (Max-Min)/6

For the Vulnerability (Vuln) section:
Vulnerability occurs any time that TCap exceeds RS, or anytime that RS (Resistance Strength) is less than TCap (Threat Capability)
Monte Carlo simulations should be used to determine the probability of these two events occuring, for TCap and RS, 10,000 random numbers to be calcuated using the PMean, PSD, and a random point of probability or distribution. After the 10,000 probabilities are created, they should be analyzed to determine every occurance of TCap being greater than RS. This analysis constitutes 1 round. 100 rounds should be performed for each occurence (Count_of_TCap_Output>RSMax)/10,000, (Count_of_RS_Output<TCapMin)/10,000, (Count_of_TCap_Output>PMean for RS)/10,000, (Count_of_RS_Output<PMean for TCap)/10,000, (Count_of_TCap_Output>RSMin)/10,000, (Count_of_RS_Output<TCapMax)/10,000

VulnMin = ((Count_of_TCap_Output>RSMax)/10,000) * ((Count_of_RS_Output<TCapMin)/10,000)
VulnML = (Count_of_TCap_Output>PMean for RS)/10,000) * ((Count_of_RS_Output<PMean for TCap)/10,000)
VulnMax = (Count_of_TCap_Output>RSMin)/10,000) * ((Count_of_RS_Output<TCapMax)/10,000)
VulnCL = Average of TCapCL and RSCL #round to the nearest value of rating. Tie would be rounded up. Very Low rating would be .1, Low rating would be .3, Moderate rating would be .5, High rating would be .7, and Very High rating would be .9

This would constitute 1 round, 100 rounds should be performed.

This would constitute 1 round, 100 rounds should be performed.

LEFMin = (avg of 100 rounds for TEF lower bound) * (avg of 100 rounds for Vuln lower bound)
LEFML = (avg of 100 rounds for TEF mean) * (avg of 100 rounds for Vuln mean)

The following calculations should be captured for both SLEF and SLM from the 10,000 probabilities: average (or mean), standard deviation, lower bound (mean - (2*Standard Deviation), and upper bound (mean + (2*Standard Deviation).
